      <h3>UCL</h3>
      <p>
        The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the most prestigious club competition
        in European football.
      </p>
      <p>
        Established in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, it was
        rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. The tournament features
        top-division European clubs competing for the coveted title. Real Madrid
        holds the record for the most UCL titles, with 15 victories as of 2026.

      <p>
        The competition begins with a league stage, which is a group of 36 teams
        which compete against each other to make the top 8 teams to
        automatically qualify for the UCL knockouts. The teams from 9th place to
        24th go through a playoff round, and the teams from 25th place to 36th
        are eliminated from the UCL. It is then followed by knockout rounds. The
        first knockout round is the Round of 16 teams, followed by the
        quarterfinals, then the semifinals, and finally the final.
