        <h2>UCL</h2>
        <p>
          The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the most prestigious club
          competition in European football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Made in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, it was rebranded as
          the UEFA Champions League in 1992. The tournament features
          top-division European clubs competing for the coveted title. Madrid
          holds the record for the most UCL titles, with 15 victories as of
          2026.

          The competition begins with a league stage, which is a group of 36
          teams which compete against each other to make the top 8 teams to
          automatically qualify for the UCL knockouts. The teams from 9th place
          to 24th go through a playoff round, and the teams from 25th place to
          36th are eliminated from the UCL. It is then followed by knockout
          rounds. The first knockout round is the Round of 16 teams, followed by
          the quarterfinals, then the semifinals, and finally the final.

        <h2>UCL Anthem</h2>
        <p>
          The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled "Champions
          League," is a piece of music composed by Tony Britten in 1992. The
          anthem is based on George Frideric Handel's "Zadok the Priest," which
          is one of the four crowning anthems composed for the crowning of King
          George II in 1727.
          <br />
          The UCL anthem is played before the start of each Champions League
          match, during the opening ceremony, and at various other moments in
          the UCL.
