        <h3>UCL</h3>
        <p>
          The UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the most prestigious club
          competition in European football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Made in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup, it was rebranded as
          the UEFA Champions League in 1992. The tournament features
          top-division European clubs competing for the coveted title. Madrid
          holds the record for the most UCL titles, with 15 victories as of
          2026.

          The competition begins with a league stage, which is a group of 36
          teams which compete against each other to make the top 8 teams to
          automatically qualify for the UCL knockouts. The teams from 9th place
          to 24th go through a playoff round, and the teams from 25th place to
          36th are eliminated from the UCL. It is then followed by knockout
          rounds. The first knockout round is the Round of 16 teams, followed by
          the quarterfinals, then the semifinals, and finally the final.
